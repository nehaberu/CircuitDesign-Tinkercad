This project proposes a non-contact plant growth monitoring system using various sensors. The proposed system measures the temperature of atmosphere around the plantâ€™s surrounding area in Fahrenheit using temperature sensor. Displays the sunlight level using a photoresistor sensor. Different kinds of plants require varying amount of sunlight for its growth. This can be monitored through the photoresistor which measures the amount of light falling on the plants. Gas sensor is used to detect various gas leaks and gas detection could prevent industrial safety dangers and potentiometer displays the moisture level in soil. The module has a built-in potentiometer for sensitivity adjustment of the digital output (DO). You can set a threshold by using a potentiometer. So, that when the moisture level exceeds the threshold value, the module will output LOW otherwise HIGH. This setup is very useful when you want to trigger an action when certain threshold is reached. For example, when the moisture level in the soil crosses a threshold, you can activate a relay to start pumping water.
Finally, the system performance is compared and verified with the measurement data that have been obtained by practical field experiments.
